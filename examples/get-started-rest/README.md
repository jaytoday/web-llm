# WebLLM Get Started App for Local Servers

This folder provides a minimum demo to show WebLLM API in a webapp setting.
To try it out, first start a local server using the steps outlined [here](https://mlc.ai/mlc-llm/docs/deploy/rest.html). Next, you can do the following steps under this folder

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Note if you would like to hack WebLLM core package.
You can change web-llm dependencies as `"file:../.."`, and follow the build from source
instruction in the project to build webllm locally. This option is only recommended
if you would like to hack WebLLM core package.
